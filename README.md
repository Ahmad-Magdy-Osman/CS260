# :arrows_clockwise: Computational Models - CS260 :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

Turing Machine, NFA, DFA, DFA Minimization, Finite Machines, Language Description, NFA to DFA, Prefix to Postfix, Sudoku Solver, Turing Machine Simulator.

I took this class in Fall 2017. Each folder is its own project/exercise. Each folder in this repository explores a topic on its own. The projects/exercises are all in Python and can be walked through easily. Projects include:

* Building a Turing Machine

* Building an NFA

* Calculator

* DFA Minimization

* Finite Machines

* Language Description

* NFA to DFA Converter

* Prefix to Postfix

* Sudoku Solver

* Turing Machine Simulator

Feel free to clone this repository and to explore the projects.
